# Calculator Program

## Stage 1: Basic Calculator
Create a calculator that takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) and shows the result.

**Constraints:**
- Handle division by zero
- Use if-elif-else statements

>Example:
>
>Input: 10, 5, +
>Output: Result = 15

## Stage 2: Add Result Check
Extend Stage 1: After showing result, check if it's positive, negative, or zero and print accordingly.

>Example:
>
>Input: 10, 5, -
>Output: 
>Result = 5
>Positive

## Stage 3: Student Grade Calculator

### Task: Calculate student grade based on marks in 3 subjects.

Input: Student name, 3 subject marks (0-100)

**Calculate:**

- Total marks
- Percentage = (total/300) * 100

- Grade Logic:   A: >= 75%   |   B: >= 60%   |   C: >= 40%   |   F: < 40%

- Output: Name, Total, Percentage, Grade

>Example:
>
>Input: Raj, 80, 70, 90
>Output: 
>Raj
>Total: 240/300
>Percentage: 80.0%
>Grade: A
